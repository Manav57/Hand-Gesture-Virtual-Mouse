# Hand-Gesture-Virtual-Mouse
A Python-based Hand Gesture Recognition system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI.   This project allows you to control the mouse cursor with your index finger, perform left/right clicks with gestures, and scroll using hand movements â€” all without touching a physical mouse.
